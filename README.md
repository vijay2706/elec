## 1. ARDUINO SOLAR TRACKER
In modern solar tracking systems,the solar panels are fixed on a structure that moves according to the position of sun.
Materials required:  Arduino UNO, Servo Motor, LDRs (Light Sensors) , Resistors.
        LDRs are used as main light sensors. Two servo motors are fixed to the solar panel.The program for arduino is uploaded to the microcontroller.
        LDRs sense the amount of sunlight falling on them.Four LDRs are divided into top,bottom,left and right.
        For east-west tracking, the anaog values from two top LDRs and two bottom LDRs are coompared and if the top set of LDRs receive more light, the vertical servo will move in that direction.
        For angular deflection of the solar panel, the analog values from two left LDRs and two right LDRs are compared. If the left set of LDRs receive more light than the right set, the horizontal servo will move in that direction.
     
     This is really very useful, by this setup we can extract maximum sunlight and convert it to useful power. So we can use the renewable source of the energy for the required power and for our daily usage.



## 2. SNAKE ROBOT USING ARDUINO
This snake robot is made using arduino, servo motors, sensors and PCB. 
The design of the snake is made by 3d printing and servo motors are connected such that some moves longitudinally and vertically.
Small camera is attached to this bot, which can travel anywhere. This can be controlled by an android app using bluetooth. And the suitable code is written

       Humans and other robots cannot inspect all tight places like narrow industrial pipes, drains, walls and floorings. This smart snake bot can crawl these narrow places with camera and give us information. This is very useful in almost all places mainly defence, medical, etc..



## 3. IoT BASED SMART DUSTBIN
This project is to monitor whether the Dustbin is full or not and if full then notify the owner through a notification on their phone and to open or close automatically.
Software requirements: Blynk app, Arduino IDE
Hardware requirements: Arduino nano, Wifi module, Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo motor, IR sensor module.
Connecting all components to the arduino board with wires. And uploading suitable code to Arduino Uno. And configuring the Blynk app and connect to the Wifi and press play button.

     This project is very useful to keep the places clean. It helps the owner by triggering when the bin is full.


## 4. Generate Electricity by Walking Power Generator Floor Tiles Project
This project starts with the designing. Designing can be done in many softwares such as solid works, autocad etc..and then fabricating the system.
Materials required: Gears, shaft, generator motor, racks, springs.
It uses the motion of the footstep to generate power with the help of metallic racks. These are mounted on the upper panel and these are pressed against the optimised gearing. 
The gear is used transfer the power to the generator motors. And it has springs which helps the platform to get back to original position.

     This projecct is very useful at almost all places. We can produce power automatically by just walking. We can actually save many resources by using this project. 
 
 
 ## 5. THIRD EYE FOR BLIND
 This is very simple project but it is very much useful to blind people. This is made with five ultrasonic sensors, blind people can detect objets in  five dimensional view around them. These five modules are connectec to differen parts of body. Among them, two for both shoulders, another two for both knees and one for the hand. When the sensor detects obstacle the device will notify th user through vibrations and sound beeps. The intensity of beeeping increases with decrease in distance and this is a fully automated device.
